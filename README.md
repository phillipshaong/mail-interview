# mail-interview
This repo will contain the data and necessary codes needed to complete coding assignment for DFS MRM Mail interview.

Included in this repo are model scores for a model which was recently validated by Model Risk Management. Your job is to develop a simple application that allows users to upload model scores and get the Population Stability Index (PSI) using the Python Script link provided.

Moreover, plot a distribution of the model scores. 

You are free to use google in this exercise and have one hour to complete. Codes must be clearly documented or commeted and be readable. Furthermore, we have included an example of an application we recently developed to help with validation of Models.

Please refer to this repo for the PSI function: https://github.com/mwburke/population-stability-index
